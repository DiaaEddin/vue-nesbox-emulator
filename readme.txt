1- copy public/flash directory to your public directory /flash
2- run npm install swfobject, npm install vue-property-decorator
3- use GamePlayer component as in example Demo.vue
note that you should host the index.html on a server becuase the emulator won't work when access from fileSystem url. 
Thank you for reading and have a good day.
